Link prediction refers to inferring the future relationships from nodes in a complex network, or more formally, estimating the likelihood of the existence of a link between two nodes based on the observed network structure and node attributes (Martinčić-Ipsˇić S, Močibob E, Perc M, 2017).
As a practical part of Master's thesis, I will build and test a GNN model (GraphSage) using Twitter data obtained with Tweepy, to execute link prediction (i.e., to predict future Twitter connections).
